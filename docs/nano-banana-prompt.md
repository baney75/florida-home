# Nano Banana Image Generation Prompt

## 🎨 Favicon & Logo Design Brief

### Purpose
Create a distinctive, modern favicon and app icon for the "Florida Home Access" PWA — a family vacation home access codes app.

### Design Requirements

**Style:**
- Clean, modern, minimalist aesthetic
- Suitable for both favicon (small) and app icon (larger)
- Must be recognizable at 16x16px and 512x512px

**Color Palette:**
- **Primary:** Maroon `#800000` (deep, rich burgundy-red)
- **Secondary/Accent:** Warm gold `#b8960c` (subtle highlights)
- **Background:** White `#FFFFFF` or transparent
- **Contrast:** Ensure excellent visibility on both light and dark backgrounds

**Imagery Concept:**
- **Primary idea:** Elegant house silhouette or home icon with a Florida twist
- **Florida elements:** Subtle palm tree, sunshine, or key motif
- **Access/Security:** Optional subtle lock, key, or shield element integrated tastefully
- **Avoid:** Generic clip art, overly complex details, gradients that don't scale

**Composition:**
- Centered, balanced design
- Bold, simple shapes that read clearly at small sizes
- Square format (1:1 aspect ratio)
- Safe margins: keep main elements within 80% of canvas

**Typography (if any text):**
- Use "FL" monogram or house icon only — NO full words
- Font: Clean, bold sans-serif
- Single letter or simple icon preferred

### Output Specifications

**Files Needed:**
1. **favicon.ico** - 16x16, 32x32 multi-resolution
2. **icon-192.png** - 192x192px for PWA
3. **icon-512.png** - 512x512px for PWA
4. **apple-touch-icon.png** - 180x180px
5. **Source file** - SVG or high-res PNG for future edits

**Format:**
- PNG with transparency for icons
- Flat design preferred (no heavy shadows)
- Crisp edges, pixel-perfect at all sizes

### Design Rationale
This app is for family use — the design should feel:
- **Trustworthy** and secure (maroon conveys stability)
- **Warm** and welcoming (gold accent, home imagery)
- **Premium** but not flashy
- **Timeless** — avoid trendy elements that will date quickly

### Reference Mood
Think: High-end real estate branding meets modern tech app. Clean lines, classic colors, professional yet approachable.

## 📋 Usage Instructions

1. **Generate images** using the prompt above in Nano Banana
2. **Review for:** Clarity at small sizes, color accuracy, simplicity
3. **Export multiple sizes:** 16, 32, 180, 192, 512px

## 🔄 Current Icons

The app currently uses programmatically generated icons:
- Maroon background (#800000)
- White house emoji (🏠) centered
- Sizes: 192x192 and 512x512

These work well but a custom-designed logo will look more professional and distinctive.
